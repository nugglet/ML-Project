# 50.007 Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
Designing a sequence labelling model for informal text using the hidden Markov model (HMM). 

## Directory Structure
Ensure that the directory structure of all scripts and dataset are as follows. 
> hmm.py
> hmm_ls.py
>/ES
    >/ES
        >dev.in
        > ...
>/RU
    >/RU    
        >dev.in
        > ...
       

## Usage
Part 1-3 has been implemented in the `hmm.py` file
Part 4 has been implemented in the `hmm_ls.py` file

When running, specify which dataset to use as additional arguments (ES or RU).

```
python hmm.py ES

python hmm.py RU
```

or

```
python hmm_ls.py ES

python hmm_ls.py RU
```
